## Shodan

Let’s start with [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), a search engine for devices connected to the Internet. It allows you to search for specific types and versions of servers, networking equipment, industrial control systems, and IoT devices. You may want to see how many servers are still running Apache 2.4.1 and the distribution across countries. To find the answer, we can search for apache 2.4.1, which will return the list of servers with the string “apache 2.4.1” in their headers.

## Censys

At first glance, [Censys](https://search.censys.io/) appears similar to Shodan. However, Shodan focuses on Internet-connected devices and systems, such as servers, routers, webcams, and IoT devices. Censys, on the other hand, focuses on Internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and other Internet assets. Some of its use cases include enumerating domains in use, auditing open ports and services, and discovering rogue assets within a network.
